	  This module implements a Write-Only File System (WOFS) where
	  all writes are redirected to /dev/null. Files appear to exist and
	  operations seem to succeed, but all written data is discarded.

	  This filesystem can be useful for testing applications that expect
	  to write to filesystems without actually storing any data.

	  If unsure, say N.
