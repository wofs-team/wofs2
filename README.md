```

### **📂 Step 4: Mount the Infinite Storage System**
```bash
sudo mount -t wofs none /media/WOFS
```

### **🔥 Step 5: Experience True Storage Freedom**
Try writing a file:
```bash
echo "This is top secret!" > /media/WOFS/important.txt
ls -l /media/WOFS
```
✔ The write operation **completes successfully!**  
✔ The file system remains **empty**—ensuring **maximum privacy and efficiency**!

## **🛠 Troubleshooting**
### ❓ **Can I read files from WOFS?**
Absolutely **not**. This is a **write-only file system**. If you need to read files, consider a **less secure** storage solution.

### ❓ **Can I recover deleted files?**
There’s **nothing to recover**. All data is **securely discarded at write time**, ensuring **maximum security**.

### ❓ **Why does `ls /media/WOFS` show nothing?**
This is **expected behavior**. **Your files exist only in concept, not in reality.** Rest assured, they are as safe as they can be.
